--One time executed code to run and take concepts from concept_relationship_manual
--TODO: There are a lot of non-deprecated relationships to non-standard (in dev_loinc) concepts.
--! Not anymore
-- Bring the list to the manual file.
-- There should be a check that force us to manually fix the manual file (even before running the 1st query to get the delta).
-- So once the concept is in the manual file, it should NOT appear in delta. Basically this is "check if target concepts are Standard and exist in the concept table"
-- Once the relationship to the specific target concept is gone, the machinery should make it D in CRM using the current_date.
